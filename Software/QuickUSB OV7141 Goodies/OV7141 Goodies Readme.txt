This directory contains the things needed to get your OV7141 demo board working with a modified QuickUSB Adapter Board.
You will need to build an interface adapter between the QuickUSB Adapter board and the OV7120AA camera module from Omnivision.
The schematic is in the 'QuickUSB Adapter Board to OV7141 Board.pdf' document.

Next, install the QuickUSB Library on your computer or at least install the driver by plugging in the module and when prompted, point the installer to the root directory of the QuickUSB Library CD.

Next, run 'QuickUSB OV7141 Diagnostics v1.08 Setup.exe'.  This will install the QuickUSB Ov7141 Diagnostics utility.  This is a utility written in Visual Basic 6.0 to run the imager in real time will full access to the digital data.  If you need the source code, give us a call.
