Mandrake 9.0 HD:
Programming directory = /home/alon/Programming/BitwiseSys/Linux
For building the QuickUSB driver you can use the make file in the directory 
/home/alon/Programming/BitwiseSys/Linux/CQuickUsb-and-Driver


the QT direcotry is /usr/local/qt
the bin files are in /usr/local/qt/bin
we were using QT designer version 3.2 on mandrake which I installed from a tar.gz file
Mandrake comes with 2.x and Redhat comes with QT 3.1. QT 3.1 had problems compiling the about box

to turn on libusb debugging level you have to edit the QuickUsbDiag.ui.h file
At the top of the file in the init function you will need to uncomment the labeled lines
to allow libusb debugging.

// setenv("USB_DEBUG", "2", 1);


use 
qmake -o Makefile QuickUsbDiagnosticStatic.pro
or
qmake -o Makefile QuickUsbDiagnosticShared.pro 

to make a make fresh make file on your system
and then type make to compile the Diag program

or use the existing makefiles by just renaming them to Makefile


Hotplug directory = /etc/hotplug/
Need to edit the file /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap to add the line
# Bitwise Systems QuickUSB Module
QuickUSB_Module 0x0003 0x0FBB 0x01 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00  0x00000000
so hotplug will detect a QuickUSB module 

Need to add the QuickUSB hotplug script to /etc/hotplug/usb/
