There is an error in the documentation:

User Guide, page 16

QuickUsbWritePort(...*length){}
	
	length is NOT a pointer. Although the equivalent Read function on the same page DOES have
	*length as a pointer.



ALSO, before trying to open the device, we have to call QuickUsbFindModules() first, otherwise it refuses
      to open the device.  We can discard the result.
