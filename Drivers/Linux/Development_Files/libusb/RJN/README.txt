These are files for the QuickUsb installer.

Use either the RPMS or the tarball.

Sadly, the libquickusb is only available as a binary - it would be *so* much more useful as source!
Also the QuickUSBDiag software doesn't work - at least on Mandrake 10.1

The examples/ directory has some very simple code, which will allow
	a) listing the devices attached
	b) Testing the parallel port (port A)

The Documentation_BUG file corrects an error in the documentation.
